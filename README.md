# Alternative Save.TV Kodi Addon

There is an offical Kodi addon that can be downloaded from the [official homepage of Save.TV](https://www.save.tv/stv/s/misc/Apps.cfm). [Florian Thomas](http://tv-forum.info/viewtopic.php?f=37&t=120)  additionally developed an alternative Kodi addon for Save.TV that is not related to the official addon. This repository contains a modified version of this alternative addon. The following features were added:

Version 1.0.2:
* Added "Genre" (Movies, Series, Sports, ...)
* Added multi page support (Next page feature)
